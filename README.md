## RAM (RANDOM ACCESS MEMORY)INVOLVES BOTH HARDWARE DESIGN AND SOFTWARE TOOLS TO CREATE,SIMULATE AND VERIFYTHE MEMORY ARCHITECTURE
THERE ARE TOW TYPES OF RAMS : SRAM(STATIC RAM) - FASTER,USES FLIP FLOPS
                              DRAM(DYNAMIC RAM) - SLOWER,STORES DATA AS CHARGE IN CAPACITORS
TOOLS USED ARE : VERILOG/VHDL (WRITING RAM ARCHITECTURE)
                MODELSIM,XSIM,ICARUS VERILOG (TO TEST AND SIMULATE BEHAVIOUR)
                XILINX VIVADO (CONVERT HDL TO GATE LEVEL)
PLATFORMS : WINDOW/LINUX - MOST EDA TOOLS TO WORK ON LINUX FOR BETTER PERFORMANCE
            FPGA DEVELOPMENT - LIKE XILINX,USED FOR PROTOTYPE
EDITORS : VIVADO IDE,MODELISM,VLSI
